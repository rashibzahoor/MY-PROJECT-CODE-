This project is a Bank Account Management System built with Flask (Python web framework) and HTML templates. It allows users to perform basic banking operations, including logging in, viewing their account summary, transferring money between accounts, updating balances, and checking transaction history.

Key Features:
User Authentication:

Users can log in using predefined credentials (username and password).
Simulated user authentication is done using a dictionary of users for simplicity.
Account Overview:

After logging in, users can view their account details, including:
Account holder's name
Account balance
Account type (e.g., Savings or Checking)
Transaction history (all past transactions)
Balance Updates:

Users can update their account balance (e.g., to reflect deposits or withdrawals).
Money Transfer:

Users can transfer money between two accounts by specifying:
Sender's account
Receiver's account
Transfer amount
The system checks if the sender has sufficient balance and processes the transfer if valid.
Both sender and receiver accounts have their balances updated, and transaction histories are recorded.
Transaction History:

Users can view a list of all transactions made on their accounts (both sent and received).
Generate Account Statement:

Users can generate an account statement showing a history of all transactions for their account.
Logout:

Users can log out and return to the login page.
Project Structure:
app.py: The Flask backend application that handles routing and logic for authentication, balance updates, transfers, transaction history, and account statements.
HTML Templates:
login.html: The login page where users enter their credentials.
home.html: The main dashboard where users can see account details after logging in.
account_summary.html: Displays the account holder's details, balance, and transactions.
transfer_form.html: The form where users input transfer details (sender, receiver, amount).
result.html: Displays the outcome of a transfer or balance update.
transactions.html: Shows the transaction history.
error.html: Displays error messages (e.g., insufficient funds or invalid account).
statement.html: Shows the user's account statement.
Technical Stack:
Flask: Used for backend web development, routing, and handling requests.
HTML: For creating dynamic web pages for user interactions.
Python: The core language for the project, handling business logic such as balance updates and transaction management.
Jinja2: Used in Flask templates to dynamically generate content based on the user's account information.
Challenges Solved:
Account Management: This system simulates real-world banking operations and offers an interactive way to manage accounts and money transfers.
Data Integrity: Ensures that account balances are updated correctly after each transaction, with adequate checks for insufficient funds.
Scalability: While this project is simple, the core logic can be expanded for more complex banking applications, including adding features like account creation, interest calculations, and more.
Potential Enhancements:
Database Integration: Integrate a real database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for storing user data, account details, and transactions.
Password Encryption: Use hashed passwords to enhance security.
User Registration: Allow users to create new accounts.
Transaction Limits/Fees: Implement limits on transfers or transaction fees.
Admin Panel: Add an admin panel for managing user accounts and overseeing transactions.
Use Cases:
Individual Bank Users: Access and manage personal bank accounts (e.g., checking balance, transferring funds, viewing transactions).
Educational Purpose: A good learning project for beginners to understand Flask, web development, and basic banking functionalities.
This system provides an easy-to-understand and practical example of common banking operations using Flask, making it a solid foundation for further improvements or real-world application development.
